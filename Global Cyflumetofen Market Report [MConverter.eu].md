**Introduction to Cyflumetofen**

Cyflumetofen is a novel acaricide belonging to the class of keto-enols,
primarily used to control mite infestations in a wide range of crops.
Known for its effectiveness against both immature and adult stages of
mites, it is especially useful in managing resistance issues that arise
from prolonged use of traditional insecticides. This active ingredient
offers long-lasting control with minimal environmental impact, making it
a preferred choice for integrated pest management (IPM) systems.

Applications of Cyflumetofen span across high-value crops such as
fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants, contributing significantly to
agricultural productivity and sustainability.
